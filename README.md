I'm a **student** of KyoungPook University.
I wanted to be a math teacher, so I studied hard to be the one.
However, I thought I was not good at teaching, so I made up my mind to study computer.
I don't regret this decision because ***I'm enjoying all of these things about computer*** even though it's difficult to think algorithms, languages, etc.

I like to sing, watch movies, take a walk, and so on.
The best one is *taking a walk* after lunch, because the weather thesedays is really good to walk.
